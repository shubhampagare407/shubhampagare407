Task-1: Basic Python Syntax Understanding
Description:
The intern will learn foundational Python concepts such as variables, data types, loops, and functions.

Responsibility:
Study Python syntax through tutorials and simple coding exercises.

Recommended Resources:
Official Python Documentation: Python Docs
Online tutorials: W3Schools Python Tutorial, Codecademy Python Course
Books: "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes
Exercises:
Write a simple "Hello, World!" program.
Practice using the Python interactive shell.

1.Practice writing basic scripts to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate strings, and use conditional statements.

Arithmetic Operations:
Write scripts that add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
Explore the use of different arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, %, **).

String Manipulation:
Practice string concatenation and replication.
Experiment with string methods (e.g., .upper(), .lower(), .find(), .replace()).

Conditional Statements:
Write scripts that use if, elif, and else statements.

Create simple programs that make decisions based on user input.
Gain familiarity with common data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples.

Lists:
Create lists and access their elements.
Use list methods such as .append(), .remove(), .pop(), .sort(), and .reverse().

Dictionaries:
Create dictionaries and access their values.
Practice adding, updating, and deleting dictionary items.

Tuples:
Create and access tuples.
Understand the immutability of tuples and where they can be used.



Sure, let's break down the content of the image and provide a structured plan to achieve the objectives listed. Here is the information extracted and a guide on how to proceed:

Sample Exercises:
Variables and Data Types
# Variables and Data Types
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.7
is_student = True

print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}, Is Student: {is_student}")

Arithmetic Operations
# Arithmetic Operations
a = 10
b = 3

print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)
print("Floor Division:", a // b)
print("Modulus:", a % b)
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)

String Manipulation
# String Manipulation
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Bob"

# Concatenation
full_greeting = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
print(full_greeting)

# Methods
print(full_greeting.upper())
print(full_greeting.lower())
print(full_greeting.replace("Bob", "Alice"))

Conditional Statements
# Conditional Statements
number = 10

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number == 0:
    print("The number is zero.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")

Lists
# Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)

# Adding an item
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)

# Removing an item
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)

# Accessing items
print(fruits[1])

Dictionaries
# Dictionaries
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "courses": ["Math", "Science"]
}
print(student)

# Accessing values
print(student["name"])
print(student["courses"])

# Adding a key-value pair
student["grade"] = "A"
print(student)

# Updating a value
student["age"] = 26
print(student)

# Removing a key-value pair
del student["courses"]
print(student)

Tuples
# Tuples
point = (3, 4)
print(point)

# Accessing tuple elements
print(point[0])
print(point[1])

# Tuples are immutable
# point[0] = 5  # This will raise an error

Exercises:
Write a simple "Hello, World!" program.

print("Hello, World!")
To run this program:

1)Open a text editor (such as Notepad, VS Code, or PyCharm).
2)Copy and paste the above code into the text editor.
3)Save the file with a .py extension, for example, hello_world.py.
4)Open a terminal or command prompt.
5)Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
6)Run the program by typing python hello_world.py and pressing Enter.

You should see the output:
Hello, World!



By following this structured approach, the intern will gain a solid understanding of basic Python syntax and foundational programming concepts.
