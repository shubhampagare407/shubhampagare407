1.Practice writing basic scripts to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate strings, and use conditional statements.

Arithmetic Operations:
Write scripts that add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
Explore the use of different arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, %, **).

String Manipulation:
Practice string concatenation and replication.
Experiment with string methods (e.g., .upper(), .lower(), .find(), .replace()).

Conditional Statements:
Write scripts that use if, elif, and else statements.

Create simple programs that make decisions based on user input.
Gain familiarity with common data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples.

Lists:
Create lists and access their elements.
Use list methods such as .append(), .remove(), .pop(), .sort(), and .reverse().

Dictionaries:
Create dictionaries and access their values.
Practice adding, updating, and deleting dictionary items.

Tuples:
Create and access tuples.
Understand the immutability of tuples and where they can be used.
